## About
<p>
  The script focuses on efficiently solving the problem of group schedule matching. Given two arrays representing booked slots and the scheduled times of group members, the algorithm aims to find time intervals when all members are available for a meeting while meeting a minimum duration requirement.
  <br><br>
  The problem entails delegating scheduling intervals, where various members have different availability windows. By employing a carefully designed algorithm, we strive to optimize the process of identifying suitable meeting times, ensuring that all members can participate for the required duration.
  <br><br>
  Our solution addresses the challenge of schedule matching with an optimized algorithm to create the most correct and efficient way to produce an availability schedule for all members. Through testing and result analysis, we aim to provide a reliable and practical tool for managing group schedules effectively.
